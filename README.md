Work completed for the BCG Data Science Job Simulation on Forage, focusing on churn prediction and data-driven insights for PowerCo.
# BCG Data Science Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my work for the **BCG Data Science Job Simulation** on **Forage**, completed in collaboration with **BCG X**, the tech build and design unit of Boston Consulting Group. BCG X leverages cutting-edge technology, data science, and human-centered design to transform bold ideas into impactful solutions.

During this simulation, I stepped into the role of a **BCG X Data Scientist** to help **PowerCo** address a customer churn challenge. While the company initially suspected price sensitivity as the key driver, the data revealed a more nuanced story. My task was to explore the datasets, generate hypotheses, build predictive models, and translate insights into actionable business recommendations.
